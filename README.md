## A Basketball Simulation

**What will the application do?** <br>
This application was made to simulate real games and predict the
outcomes of games with the players chosen by the users. This is done
for users who are curious how their favorite players will do when they are
teamed up together.

**Who will use it?** <br>
Avid fan of the every basketball league in the world will be able to use
this easily to get an accurate prediction on who will win on teams with the
given players.

**Why is this project of interest to you?** <br>
I am a big fan of the NBA, so I am often curious what will happen
if my favorite players teamed up with each other or go up against each
other.
