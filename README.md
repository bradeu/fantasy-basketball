## A Monopoly Game

**What will the application do?** <br>
This application is similar to the monopoly game but with an addition of power cards 
that can move the player more than what the dice decides or the power cards that can 
allow a player to avoid jail.

**Who will use it?** <br>
Everyone will be able to use this, it will be made simple and understandable 
by people of all ages.

**Why is this project of interest to you?** <br>
I have never made a game before, so this project serves as an exploration to a new field 
in the world of computer science.
